# CHAPTER 3 : Linear Neural Networks for Regression

## 3.1.6 Exercises -

- Assume that we have some data $𝑥_1,...,𝑥_𝑛 \in R$. Our goal is to find a constant 𝑏 such that $\sum_i(x_i - b)^2$ is minimized.
    1. Find an analytic solution for the optimal value of 𝑏.
    2. How does this problem and its solution relate to the normal distribution?
    3. What if we change the loss from $\sum(x_i - b)^2 $ to $\sum|x_i-b|$? Can you find the optimal solution for 𝑏?
